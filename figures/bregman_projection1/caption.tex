Geometry of the Bregman divergence with the seed function $f(z)=\frac{1}{2}z^\intercal z$. $h(z)$ is a hyperplane tangent to $f(z)$ at $y$. While it accurately represent $f(y)$, it underestimate $f(x)$. The Bregman divergence measures how much the representation of $f(x)$ on $h(z)$ \emph{diverges} from $f(x)$ (in green).

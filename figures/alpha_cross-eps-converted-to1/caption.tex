(a): Swelling effect of Arithmetic mean shown through log-determinant values. Training trials are taken from the 13Hz class of the subject with the highest BCI performance. Log-determinant values are given for each trial covariance (points), and for means of Table~\ref{tab:dist} (horizontal lines). (b): Classification accuracy and CPU time, obtained with $\alpha$-divergence for $-1\leqslant \alpha  \leqslant 1$.

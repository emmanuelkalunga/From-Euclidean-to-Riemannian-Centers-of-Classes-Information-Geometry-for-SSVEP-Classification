Representation of covariance matrices: each image is the covariance matrix mean $\Pm^{(\ci)}$ of the class $\ci$, for one session of the recording. The diagonal blocks show the covariance in different frequency bands, i.e. 13Hz in the upper-left block, 21Hz in the middle, and 17Hz in the bottom-right. Subjects with highest (a) and lowest (b) BCI performance.

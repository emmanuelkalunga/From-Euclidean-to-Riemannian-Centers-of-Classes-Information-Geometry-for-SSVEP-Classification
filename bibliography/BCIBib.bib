  abstract = {Interest in developing a new method of man-to-machine communication-a
	brain-computer interface ({BCI})-has grown steadily over the past
	few decades. {BCIs} create a new communication channel between the
	brain and an output device by bypassing conventional motor output
	pathways of nerves and muscles. These systems use signals recorded
	from the scalp, the surface of the cortex, or from inside the brain
	to enable users to control a variety of applications including simple
	word-processing software and orthotics. {BCI} technology could therefore
	provide a new communication and control option for individuals who
	cannot otherwise express their wishes to the outside world. Signal
	processing and classification methods are essential tools in the
	development of improved {BCI} technology. We organized the {BCI}
	Competition 2003 to evaluate the current state of the art of these
	tools. Four laboratories well versed in {EEG}-based {BCI} research
	provided six data sets in a documented format. We made these data
	sets (i.e., labeled training sets and unlabeled test sets) and their
	descriptions available on the Internet. The goal in the competition
	was to maximize the performance measure for the test labels. Researchers
	worldwide tested their algorithms and competed for the best classification
	results. This paper describes the six data sets and the results and
	function of the most successful algorithms.},

  abstract = {A brain-computer interface ({BCI}) is a system that allows its users
	to control external devices with brain activity. Although the proof-of-concept
	was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into
	device control commands is still a major challenge. Success requires
	the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's
	brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the
	{BCI} system, which translates that activity into device control
	commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories
	are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve
	the adaptation of the {BCI} system to the user. In the literature,
	many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have
	been reported to give impressive results when applied to {BCI} data
	in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their
	relative value for actual online use. {BCI} data competitions have
	been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative
	methods. Prompted by the great interest in the first two {BCI} Competitions,
	we organized the third {BCI} Competition to address several of the
	most difficult and important analysis problems in {BCI} research.
	The paper describes the data sets that were provided to the competitors
	and gives an overview of the results.},

	and today many researchers in the academia and industry are interested
	in this direction. It enables human being to interact with machine
	very easily and conveniently without wearing any extra device. It
	can be applied from sign language recognition to robot control and
	from virtual reality to intelligent home systems. In this paper we
	are discussing work done in the area of hand gesture recognition
	where focus is on the soft computing based methods like artificial
	neural network, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, etc. We also described
	hand detection methods in the preprocessed image for detecting the
	hand image. Most researchers used fingertips for hand detection in
	appearance based modeling. Finally we are comparing results given
	by different researchers after their implementation.}

  abstract = {After about 30 years of research on {Brain-Computer} Interfaces ({BCIs})
	there is little knowledge about the phenomenon, that some people

	learn {BCI}-control. To elucidate this " {BCI}-inefficiency" phenomenon,
	the current study investigated whether psychological parameters,
	such as attention span, personality or motivation, could predict
	performance in a single session with a {BCI} controlled by modulation
	of sensorimotor rhythms ({SMR}) with motor imagery. A total of N
	= 83 healthy {BCI} novices took part in the session. Psychological
	parameters were measured with an electronic test-battery including
	clinical, personality and performance tests. Predictors were determined
	by binary logistic regression analyses. The output variable of the
	{Two-Hand} Coordination Test ({2HAND}) \" overall mean error duration\"
	which is a measure for the accuracy of fine motor skills accounted
	for 11\% of the variance in {BCI}-inefficiency. The Attitudes Towards
	Work ({AHA}) test variable \"performance level\" which can be interpreted
	as a degree of concentration and a neurophysiological {SMR} predictor
	were also identified as significant predictors of {SMR} {BCI} performance.
	Psychological parameters as measured in this study play a moderate
	role for one-session performance in a {BCI} controlled by modulation
	of {SMR}. Fine motor skills predict {SMR}-{BCI} performance. The
	amount of concentration predicts {SMR}-{BCI} performance. Biological,
	psychological and physiological factors lead to an explanation of
	30\% of the variance in {SMR}-{BCI} performance.}

	commands to computers solely by means of brain activity. {BCIs} are
	gaining interest among the virtual reality ({VR}) community since
	they have appeared as promising interaction devices for virtual environments
	({VEs}). The key features of the platform are (1) high modularity,
	(2) embedded tools for visualization and feedback based on {VR} and
	{3D} displays, (3) {BCI} design made available to non-programmers
	thanks to visual programming, and (4) various tools offered to the
	different types of users. The platform features are illustrated in
	this paper with two entertaining {VR} applications based on a {BCI}.
	In the first one, users can move a virtual ball by imagining hand
	movements, while in the second one, they can control a virtual spaceship
	using real or imagined foot movements. Online experiments with these
	applications together with the evaluation of the platform computational
	performances showed its suitability for the design of {VR} applications
	controlled with a {BCI}. {OpenViBE} is a free software distributed

	In this paper, we introduce a novel {HMI} device for non-contact

	of the proposed device is the {IPA} (infrared Proximity Array) sensor
	by which realtime 3 dimensional depth information can be captured
	and realized for machine control. For the usability study, two different
	operating modes are adopted for hand motion inputs: one is a finger
	tip control mode and the other is a palm control mode. Throughput
	of the proposed device has been studied and compared to a traditional
	mouse device for usability evaluation. During the human subject test,
	the proposed device is found to be useful for {PC} mouse pointer
	control. The experimental results are shared in the paper as well.}

  abstract = {{Brain-Computer} Interfaces ({BCIs}) allow a user to control a computer
	application by brain activity as acquired, e.g., by {EEG}. One of
	the biggest challenges in {BCI} research is to understand and solve
	the problem of \"{BCI} Illiteracy\", which is that {BCI} control
	does not work for a non-negligible portion of users (estimated 15
	to 30\%). Here, we investigate the illiteracy problem in {BCI} systems
	which are based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. In this
	paper, a sophisticated adaptation scheme is presented which guides
	the user from an initial subject-independent classifier that operates
	on simple features to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier
	within one session while the user interacts the whole time with the
	same feedback application. While initial runs use supervised adaptation
	methods for robust co-adaptive learning of user and machine, final
	runs use unsupervised adaptation and therefore provide an unbiased
	measure of {BCI} performance. Using this approach, which does not
	involve any offline calibration measurement, good performance was
	obtained by good {BCI} participants (also one novice) after 3-6 min
	of adaptation. More importantly, the use of machine learning techniques
	allowed users who were unable to achieve successful feedback before
	to gain significant control over the {BCI} system. In particular,
	one participant had no peak of the sensory motor idle rhythm in the
	beginning of the experiment, but could develop such peak during the
	course of the session (and use voluntary modulation of its amplitude
	to control the feedback application).},

	accuracy, the conventional P300 speller often exhibits errors, which

	address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid brain-computer interface
	({BCI}) approach by incorporating the steady-state visual evoked
	potential ({SSVEP}) into the conventional P300 paradigm. Approach.
	We designed a periodic stimuli mechanism and superimposed it onto
	the P300 stimuli to increase the difference between the symbols in
	the same row or column. Furthermore, we integrated the random flashings
	and periodic flickers to simultaneously evoke the P300 and {SSVEP},
	respectively. Finally, we developed a hybrid detection mechanism
	based on the P300 and {SSVEP} in which the target symbols are detected
	by the fusion of three-dimensional, time-frequency features. Main
	results. The results obtained from 12 healthy subjects show that
	an online classification accuracy of 93.85\% and information transfer
	rate of 56.44 bit/min were achieved using the proposed {BCI} speller
	in only a single trial. Specifically, 5 of the 12 subjects exhibited
	an information transfer rate of 63.56 bit/min with an accuracy of
	100\%. Significance . The pilot studies suggested that the proposed
	{BCI} speller could achieve a better and more stable system performance
	compared with the conventional P300 speller, and it is promising
	for achieving quick spelling in stimulus-driven {BCI} applications.}
